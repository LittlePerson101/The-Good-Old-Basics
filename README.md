# Wait, so what is this?
Ol' Reliable is a Minecraft ModPack that I have been working on for some time. The aim of this project is to create a pack that is, reliable (I mean, it's kinda in the name). Ol' Reliable has many mods that are great utilities for those who enjoy a chill single-player experience. Or create havoc, it's up to you. Currently, I have this project in versions between 1.21.5 and 1.18.1-ish, but I am working on getting more versions out.

## So what does this thing have?
Great question, if you asked lol! This Modpack has a bunch of mods that are user-friendly to builders like: Litematica, Freecam, Iris, and WorldEdit. Also if you like quality-of-life features, I have that too! For example: Shulker Box Tooltip, Voice Chat, Fast IP Ping, Gamma/Fullbright, Dynamic FPS, and a bunch of other stuff! I know a lot of ppl are into PvP based packs, so I might sprinkle in some mods that help with that when I release v2.0 but it's up to you guys!

## So what versions are getting support?

### Fabric
As of now fabric will be my top priority for the most part, with it's versions spanning between 1.18.2 and whatever the most recent one might be! If I'm taking a while to update to the newest version it's likely that one of the mods in the pack is still in development. THIS IS NOT AN EXCUSE TO GO OUT AND COMMENT ON ONE OF THE DEV'S DISCORDS ASKING THEM WHEN THEY WILL RELEASE THE VERSION!!! The devs have lives so please respect that! I usually try to keep up with the mods but even I have a life too, at least i think.

### NeoForge
 Also my other priority is NeoForge which will have versions 1.21.1+ but support will be spotty.

### Forge
The will be "some" support for Forge, depending how you look at it. There will be Forge support with shaders for 1.20.1 and some 1.19 versions supporting shaders. Versions after 1.20.1 will not be supported though.


# Ok WAIT Before you download! Read this!
I have indeed heard about the controversy about the Essential Mod! This pack does have Essential! If you prefer not to use the mod for whatever reason: I DO NOT JUDGE! Then please be on the lookout for the Non-Essential version, it's still in the works tho so maybe in like a month! I'll link it in the desc. when I get it working!

## Having Issues? Or an idea for the pack!
Check out my GitHub repository and write in the issues tab! Even if it's not an issue! 

Also not related to the above BUT: This is'nt the most "Fair-Play Friendly" Modpack because of Xaero's Minimap and Freecam and such. So I am not responsible if you get banned off a server because of this pack, be sure to read the servers opinion on these mods before playing for the best experience!

## Versioning 
If you aren't the best at deciphering numbers and metadata, then heres the simple answer. The big green download button at the top is your friend, just click it, choose your version and modloader and have fun! If you dare to take on the challenge of my messy ahh versioning system then heres the basic algorithm:

Heres an example from the 1.0.1 update for 1.21.6-1.21.7:
The 1.0.1 update is just for 1.21.6 and 1.21.7, meaning all other versions will stay on 1.0.0 (or whatever they're on at the time of you seeing this) ALWAYS check the changelog for what a new update changes. Just because another version says 1.0.1 doesn't mean that it got an update the same as this one. Remember one thing with versioning: the later the number, the better, ex:1.2.8 to 1.1.4, you always want the latest release for your pack (1.2.8).


Anyhow! That's it for now! Enjoy the Reliable Experience lol.
